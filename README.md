## About The Project
![Software][software-screenshot]
The project implements TestCafe (JavaScript-based testing tool/framework), 
in order to conduct end-to-end (E2E) testing on any client owned test environment. 

Using this project, the QA team will be responsible for:

* Verifying the working order of a software product in a start-to-finish process
* Testing from the end userâ€™s experience by simulating real user scenarios
* Validating the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity
* Reporting the results considered to be bugs and fixes

Additionally, this project will allow the team to test the web application on different browsers.

### Running Tests

1. Run a test file:
   ````
   testcafe chrome mytestfile.js
   ````
2. Run a test file in live mode:
   ````
   testcafe chrome mytestfile.js --live
   ````
**NOTE**: While running in live mode, test scripts can be modified using a code editor or an IDE, simultaneously.

3. Run all tests, inside `tests` directory:
